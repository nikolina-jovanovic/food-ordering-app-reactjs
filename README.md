_Food ordering app_

-I recommend running this code on your machine,since github pages (which hosted this project) doesn't represent the code in the same way as VSCode (images can't load, first render also is not the same...).

Simple burger ordering app made for practice.
-Used React Hooks (useState,useEffect),axios,React Router,onClick,onChange events;

I used DOCUMENU API (with Axios) to get item names and prices. Images and descriptions were made by me.
In this simple app, user can see an image of burger, and when he hovers, some information are provided: Burger name, description, price and 'add to cart' button.
When he adds to a cart, we can see 'order' in nav bar, where all info about order is stored. There is '+' and '-' button for incrementing/decrementing amount of items.
At the end,there is a total sum which user is going to pay.
